## 🎯 Usage Guide

### Disease Detection
1. Navigate to the **Disease Classifier** page
2. Upload or capture an image of cassava leaves
3. Click **"Analyze Image"** to process
4. Review the AI diagnosis and confidence score
5. Read detailed symptoms and recommendations

### Getting Farming Advice
1. Visit the **Advisory System** page
2. Type your question in natural language

4. Receive personalized recommendations
5. Ask follow-up questions for clarification

## 🔬 Disease Detection Capabilities

The system can identify:

| Disease | Symptoms | Confidence Range |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **CMD** | Mosaic patterns, leaf distortion, stunted growth | 85-95% |
| **CBSD** | Brown streaks in roots, yellow leaf spots | 75-85% |
| **CBB** | Water-soaked spots, stem cankers, wilting | 80-90% |
| **Healthy** | Normal green leaves, healthy growth | 90-98% |

## 🌍 Expected Impact

- **Early disease detection** prevents widespread crop damage
- **Reduced crop losses** through timely intervention
- **Improved yields** with better management practices
- **Knowledge empowerment** for smallholder farmers
- **Sustainable farming** practices promotion

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
